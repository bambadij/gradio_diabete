# Gradio Customer Predicting Diabete App üíª

This project uses a trained machine learning model to build a web interface that allows anyone to use the classification model to predict.

## Setting up the Environment üçÄ

1. Create a Python virtual environment to isolate the project's required libraries and avoid conflicts. Execute the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
 
2. Activate the Python virtual environment to use the isolated Python kernel and libraries. Run the appropriate command based on your operating system:

    - For Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    - For Linux and MacOS:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Upgrade Pip, the package manager, to ensure you have the latest version. Use the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

4. Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Run the command:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

*Note: If you encounter any issues on MacOS, please make sure Xcode is installed.*

- Run the demo apps (being at the repository root):

  Gradio: 
  
    For development

      gradio app.py
    
    For normal deployment/execution

      python app.py
